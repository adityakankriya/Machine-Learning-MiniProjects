# Machine Learning MiniProjects

Welcome to the "Machine-Learning-MiniProjects" repository! This repository showcases a collection of mini projects undertaken as part of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning." Each project delves into different areas of machine learning, demonstrating practical applications and techniques.

## Projects Overview

### DeCAPTCHA

Folder: [DeCAPTCHA](./DeCAPTCHA)

DeCAPTCHA project focuses on developing a character recognition system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to preprocess images, segment characters, and classify them using a CNN model. The project highlights the significance of noise reduction, rotation, and segmentation techniques, resulting in an accurate character recognition system.

### The Code Corrector

Folder: [The Code Corrector](./The%20Code%20Corrector)

"The Code Corrector" project addresses the challenge of automated program repair. This project emphasizes the implementation of machine learning techniques to suggest repairs for code that fails to compile. Through mathematical derivations and analysis, the project aims to enhance the learning experience for programming students by providing constructive feedback.

### XOR PUF Response Predictor

Folder: [XOR PUF Response Predictor](./XOR%20PUF%20Response%20Predictor)

"XOR PUF Response Predictor" project explores the properties of XOR-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and their response predictions. Using mathematical proofs and dimensional mappings, the project demonstrates how PUF responses can be predicted using linear models. This insightful project sheds light on the behavior of XOR PUFs and their potential applications.
